# Scripts that I might need to revisit
This repo serves as a dump for all the shell scripts that I have used at some point in my life and may require in the future.

* get_github_links_of_installed_packages.sh :- retrieves the Github links of all installed packages in Arch Linux
* padding_fix.sh create properly number padded files. For example: 1.png, 2.png, ...., 50.png,...., 118.png will be padded as 001.png, 002.png, ..., 050.png, ..., 118.png

* call_amma.sh : repeatedly calls someone under the given parameters. Dependence on adb.
* get_github_links_of_all_pip_packages.sh :- retrieves the Github links of all installed pip packages in your Linux system.
